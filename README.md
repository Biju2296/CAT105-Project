In this project, I participated in end-to-end manual testing for a web application, ensuring high-quality deliverables by focusing on core functionalities and user experience. 
My testing process was comprehensive, covering everything from user account management to cross-device responsiveness.

Test Case Management & Defect Tracking: I utilized JIRA for defect tracking and Zephyr for test case management to organize and execute tests. 
This ensured that all test cases were well-documented, and any defects found during testing were logged with precise details for faster resolution. 
Test case execution and bug tracking were efficiently managed within these tools, allowing for seamless communication between the QA and development teams.

Core Functional Testing: Authored and executed detailed test cases for critical user functionalities, including the login, sign-up, and logout processes. 
This ensured that users could securely access and manage their accounts. 
For example, I validated various user scenarios like incorrect login credentials, email format validation, 
and password strength checks to ensure the system behaves as expected under both normal and edge case conditions.

System Behavior Validation: Validated the application’s behavior when users entered various inputs, 
specifically testing for correct email formats and strong password requirements during account creation. 
This process helped ensure that the application maintained security standards and prevented invalid data from being submitted.

Bug Identification & Collaboration: During testing, I meticulously documented test results, logged bugs, and included detailed reproduction steps in JIRA. 
I worked closely with the development team to prioritize and resolve issues swiftly, ensuring minimal disruption to the overall development timeline.

UI/UX Testing Across Devices: As part of ensuring the platform’s usability, I assessed the UI/UX consistency across multiple devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
This testing ensured that the application was responsive and provided an optimal user experience, no matter the device or screen size. 
I reported any inconsistencies or issues with layout, navigation, or accessibility to ensure the final product was user-friendly.
